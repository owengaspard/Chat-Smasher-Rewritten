# Chat-Smasher-Rewritten
My friend and I made this program as a **JOKE**.  Please do not try to use this with any malicious intent.  Plus, Discord has gotten better at recgonzing spam since we made this in 2020.

## About the code
This is made using C# on the .NET Framework 4.8 and WinForms.  That means this program is Windows only, but I may make a cross-platform version for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
This code may be very sloppy because my friend and I made this when we learned C# (it took around a week).

## How to run
You can either download the pre-compiled version from the `Releases` tab, or you can download the source code and edit it using Microsoft's Visual Studio.  It was originally made in Visual Studio 2019, but the 2022 version works too.

### How to compile
If you actually need this, you probably should not mess with the soruce code.  When you download the source code, open the `.sln` file using your desired version of Visual Studio (Do **NOT** use VS Code).  You can choose at the top toolbar to compile and run in debug or release mode.  I suggest debug mode because it allows you to have metrics on the computer's performance.

## Contributions
- [Ryl4n](https://github.com/Ryl4n) - Rylan is the original author of the Chat Smasher project.  While we worked on the original version of Chat Smasher together, I rewrote and redesigned the program from the ground-up because I found the original to be clunky and slow.  Rylan was the reason why I decided to learn C# and has been an inspiration for wanting to learn even more languages than I knew at the time.  Thanks, Rylan.
